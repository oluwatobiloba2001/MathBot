## Introduction

MathBot is a beginner-friendly script that provides an interactive way to learn about the JavaScript `Math` object. From generating random numbers to rounding values and finding minimum/maximum numbers, this project covers a variety of `Math` functionalities.

## Features

- Introduces the `Math.random()` method to generate random numbers.
- Demonstrates rounding methods like `Math.floor()`, `Math.ceil()`, and `Math.round()`.
- Explains how to find the maximum and minimum values from a set of numbers using `Math.max()` and `Math.min()`.
- Provides simple, clear examples for each method.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy the code into your JavaScript environment.
2. Open the project in a text editor or IDE.
3. Run the script in a Node.js environment or directly in a browser console.

## Code Walkthrough

The script begins with a friendly greeting from MathBot:

```javascript
const botName = "MathBot";
const greeting = `Hi there! My name is ${botName} and I am here to teach you about the Math object!`;
console.log(greeting);
```

Each subsequent section introduces a `Math` method with an explanation and an example output. Here is an example of generating a random number between two values:

```javascript
const min = 1;
const max = 100;
const randomNum2 = Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
console.log(randomNum2);
```

Finally, the script ends with a message of appreciation for exploring the Math methods with MathBot.

## Methods Demonstrated

### 1. Random Number Generation
- `Math.random()`: Generates a pseudo-random number between `0` and less than `1`.

### 2. Rounding Methods
- `Math.floor()`: Rounds a value down to the nearest whole number.
- `Math.ceil()`: Rounds a value up to the nearest whole number.
- `Math.round()`: Rounds a value to the nearest whole number.

### 3. Maximum and Minimum Values
- `Math.max()`: Finds the largest number in a given set.
- `Math.min()`: Finds the smallest number in a given set.
